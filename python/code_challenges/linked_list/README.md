# Singly Linked List

- implement new data-sahpe and manipulate it.

## BIG O_________

- >time(insert) --> O(1)
- >space(insert) --> O(1)
- >time(includes & to_string methods ) --> O(n)
- >space(includes & to_string methods ) --> O(n)

## Testing

- [x] Can successfully instantiate an empty linked list.
- [x] The head property will properly point to the first node in the linked list.
- [x] Can properly insert into the linked list.
- [x] Can properly insert multiple nodes into the linked list.
- [x] Will return true when finding a value within the linked list that exists.
- [x] Will return false when searching for a value in the linked list that does not exist.
- [x] Can properly return a collection of all the values that exist in the linked list.

---

- LinkedList.insert()

        Adds a new node with that value to the head of the list.

- LinkedList.includes()

        Indicates whether that value exists as a Node’s value somewhere within the list.

- LinkedList.to_string()

        Returns a formatted string representing all the values in the Linked List.
